This dataset presents the baseband LoRa physical layer (PHY) waveforms captured in the form of discrete complex IQ sequences.

As an aim to keep most of the physical layer imperfection effects within the transmissions, only minimal pre-processing is done to the captured LoRa PHY waveform. The processing includes: 1)downconversion from bandpass to baseband, and 2) energy detection to locate the actual transmission within the receiver frame. 

All the data are in MATLAB .mat file format, with the file name of each file indicating the timestamp of the capture of a single transmission.

For more details on the metadata and parameters of the waveform and the hardware, please refer to the PDF data description file.
